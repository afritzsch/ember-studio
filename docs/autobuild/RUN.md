## Phase notes

### Phase 1 (2026-11-02)
- Wave: T-032 app shell (U+B, resume of `t-032-app-shell`), T-025 M2 goldens (E, resume of `t-025-m2-goldens`), T-042 note commands + instrument slot (M, new), T-035 crossfades (D, new).
- Start: week 0%, five-hour window 26%.
- `git worktree remove` on the merged `t-031-persistence` worktree needs `--force` (it contains submodules), and auto mode denied that. The worktree is left for the user to remove.
